# multilabelclassification
Multi label classification of amazon rainforest images using deep learning(Convolutional Neural Network) project

The objective of the project is to predict all the available labels in the image. It is a Multi-label image classification problem of the satellite images of the Amazon forest. The dataset has almost forty thousand images of the Amazon forest. Each image may have multiple labels. There are seventeen different types of labels. So the aim is to build a Convolutional Neural Network to process the images, label the images and test the accuracy achieved by the network.
